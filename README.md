# EE337 IIT Bombay Instructor NFTs

This repository is a fork of the [Eth2 Book Contributor NFT repository (eth2-book-nfts)](https://github.com/smartcontracts/eth2-book-nfts). The latter was created to recognize contributors to [a book on ETH2](https://github.com/smartcontracts/eth2-book).

The goal of the current repository is to create and send NFTs to outstanding instructors (RAs, TAs, lab staff) of the [EE337 Microprocessor Lab](https://ee337.github.io/) at [IIT Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in).

This is not an official project, i.e. IIT Bombay does not endorse or even know about it. It is an experiment where I hope to understand NFT deployment workflow and costs. I am personally paying for the gas costs.

To keep costs low, the NFTs will be created on [Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/) and are [viewable on Quixotic](https://quixotic.io/collection/0xFC822D5DD3afe8d01075617684ECd8d3D88e6C6C). These choices are identical to those made by the [eth2-book-nfts](https://github.com/smartcontracts/eth2-book-nfts) project.

Optimism is a leading layer 2 scaling solution (optimistic rollup) on Ethereum. Quixotic seems to be a leading NFT marketplace for Optimism.
